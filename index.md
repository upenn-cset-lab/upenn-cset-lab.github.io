# Center for Systems Epidemiology and Transplant Exposomics (C-SET)

## Mission

C-SET advances understanding of how complex, multidimensional environmental exposures influence solid organ transplant outcomes through systems epidemiology, biostatistics, and causal inference.

---

## Scientific Focus

- Exposome characterization  
- Spatiotemporal modeling  
- Distributed lag and time-varying exposure-response frameworks  
- Machine learning integration  
- Risk prediction and clinical decision support  

---

## Infrastructure

C-SET integrates national transplant datasets (e.g., USRDS), high-resolution environmental exposure data, and spatial linkage frameworks to build scalable, reproducible analytical pipelines.
